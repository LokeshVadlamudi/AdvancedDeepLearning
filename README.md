Assignment 1:
Multi Instance Learning:
It is a weakly supervised method where set of labeled bags containing huge number of instances are used to train instead of set of labeled instances. 

Assignment 2:
Semi Supervised Learning:
In this method, we use large number of unlabeled data along with little bit of labeled data to create good classifiers. It also requires less effort and gives great accuracy too. There are many semi supervised learning methods.
